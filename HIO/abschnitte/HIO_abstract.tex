\begin{abstract}
We define the problem of dynamic systems with structural errors and explain how 
an auxiliary system with hidden inputs can help to determine such structural errors. 
For the case of linear systems, sufficient and necessary conditions in the means analytical 
properties are provided to check whether hidden inputs can be uniquely determined or not. 
We will call such systems hidden input observable.
Furthermore we show how dynamic systems can be interpreted as networks and deduce a graphical 
criterion for hidden input observability.
Finally we give examples for observable and unobservable systems and try to compute 
hidden inputs via the greedy-approach gradient-method.
