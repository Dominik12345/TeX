\section{Conclusion}
As the example shows, the R package \textsf{seeds} is able to correct systematic errors in 
dynamic model on the level of the systems equations based on optimization principles of the 
DEN. It is able to detect the errors, and to simultaneously estimate the errors and the 
system state. We want to point out that, depending on the properties of the system, cases 
may occur where error are not observable. However the provided algorithms have proven to 
yield good results in various realistic problems and may be a fruitful tool whenever the lack of 
a precise model inhibits a satisfying state estimation.
